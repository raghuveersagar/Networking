Clients for Protocol and Other Networking Projects 


python projects:

TFTP client:tftp is protocol for file transfers.This implementation provides all tftp features.Built on top of UDP it  handles reliability of data transfers by using retransmissions and ACK tracking.   

The python project is an XMPP chat client with features like contact list,location information and live updates of contacts.
I am in the process of re-writing it in C# with Windows Phone SDK 8.1.
